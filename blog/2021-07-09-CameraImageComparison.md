Comparison of image quality between the standard Raspberry Pi Camera and the High Quality Raspberry Pi camera.

<!--truncate-->

The image was taken with the standard Raspberry Pi camera. The camera has trouble at close-up images, within 6" or less.
Lighting is fair on the image, however use of LEDs or increased natural lighting could help. The camera is portable and works well
with the Pan-Tilt electronic, which moves the camera around horizontally and vertically. Lenses would also be beneficial, however
the standard camera will have limitations below the High Quality Camera.
