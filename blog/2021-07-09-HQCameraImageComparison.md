Comparison of image quality between the standard Raspberry Pi Camera and the High Quality Raspberry Pi camera.

<!--truncate-->

The image was taken with the High Quality Raspberry Pi camera. The camera has very high quality at close-up images, within 6" or less.
Lighting on the image is poorer than the standard camera, and the use of external lighting is necessary for best quality of images.
This could be a challenge, as the High Quality camera requires a lense for proper usage. These lenses all require a certain amount
of space that is more than the Pan-Tilt can handle, however a gymbal or specialty attachment could alleviate the issue. The high
quality camera has positive potential as low light images still provided more precise images, and all issues can be solved to an
extent.
