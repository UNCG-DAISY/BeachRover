Rendering of the prototype base for attaching electronics to the RC chassis.

<!--truncate-->

The base for the RC car will be used for attaching electronics of the Raspberry Pi in a central location. The electronics will include the physical Raspberry Pi as well
as the parts for the Navio2 board, and any sensors used to get readings of the environment. There is also a mounting location in the front of the base that will serve as a
location for the Pan-Tilt and respective camera, however the mount will also work for attaching any other Pi electronic as most large parts share the same mounting
dimensions as the Pan-Tilt. These will be mounted using the smaller bolt holes while the larger holes will be used for attaching the base to the RC chassis. 

The decision
to 3D-print the base stems from the ease of accessiblity, as well as the ability to create various iterations of a base at an reasonable price. Other options such as a
wooden base or laser-cut base are also available, however these resources are more difficult to access. The base is still in development to fit the 3D-printer constraints
and any additions for future parts.
