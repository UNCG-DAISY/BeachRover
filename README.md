# Overview

The Beach Rover Project was started with the intent to
make monitoring and surveying the coastline faster, easier,
and more accurate than the current by-hand method through
a rover running pre-planned missions gathering various sensor data.

We are documenting the development of the rover on a dedicated site: https://uncg-daisy.github.io/BeachRover
